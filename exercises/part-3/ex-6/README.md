For the example-frontend application, building the original Dockerfile results in a container
with a size of 1.22GB. 

Joining multiple RUN commands into one results at most a very marginal reduction in image size: the reported size is again 1.22GB.

After removing unneeded files from the image, the reported size drops down to 1.04GB.

The final version (tag: remove-unneeded-files) is included in this directory as Dockerfile.frontend.

$Â docker image ls example-frontend

For the example-backend application, building the original Dockerfile results in a container with a size of 1.07GB.

Joining multiple RUN commands into one results in very little reduction in image size.
Likewise, after removing unneeded files from the image, the reported size is still 1.07GB, 
the same as with the original Dockerfile up to a hundredth of a gigabyte.

The final version (tag: remove-unneeded-files) is included in this directory as Dockerfile.backend.

$ docker image ls example-backend
REPOSITORY        TAG                     IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
example-backend   remove-unneeded-files   35b512e006f1   7 seconds ago   1.07GB
