The following command should be sufficient to launch enough compute nodes for the assignment to pass:
docker compose up --scale compute=10

Please note that I was actually unable to verify that the frontend tests now pass, as all the network
requests failed due to CORS policy violations. However, this command did indeed launch 10 copies
of the compute container, so at least the opportunity for parallellism is there.
As the exercise did not appear to be mainly concerned with CORS settings,
and as a random selection of students seems to also have struggled with this issue (see eg. https://discord.com/channels/757581218085863474/871672197012410399/1150316362334482503),
I decided not to expend any further effort on this exercise.
