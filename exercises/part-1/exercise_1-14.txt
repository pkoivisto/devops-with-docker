For building and running the backend container, the following commands were issued - 
they expect the frontend to be making requests from an origin of http://localhost:8000

docker build -t example-backend .
docker run -e REQUEST_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8000 -p 8080:8080 example-backend

For building and running the frontend container, the commands are given below.
Note that we need to pass the REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL variable as a build time argument.
This is because the value must be available for the static JS files served as the container
is run.

docker build -t example-frontend --build-arg REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080/ .
docker run -p 8000:5000 example-frontend
