The requested Dockerfile can be found under the path `exercises/part-1/example-frontend/Dockerfile`

Running the dockerized application can be done by copying the abovementioned Dockerfile
to the root of the example-frontend application and running eg. the following commands:

docker build -t example-frontend .
docker run -p 8000:5000 example-frontend

We're binding the container port 5000 to the host port 8000, as it was mentioned that
at least on MacOS the port 5000 may be reserved.
